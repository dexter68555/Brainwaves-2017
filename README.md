# Brainwaves-2017

This is a simple run on portfolio profit prediction.
The dataset is from Brainwaves 2017 challenges.
https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/brainwaves-17-1/machine-learning/predict-annual-returns/analytics/

This dataset is very small.
I don't have the actual portfolio return of the testing dataset provided.
So, I split 10% of the training dataset as the testing dataset.

The R2 score is 96%.
It is pretty good but the dataset is too small.
So, this result can only be used as a reference.

You can check my code from https://github.com/dexter68555/Brainwaves-2017/blob/master/Simple%20Portfolio%20Return%20Prediction.ipynb

It shows my code and the result.
